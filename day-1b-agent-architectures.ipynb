A `LoopAgent` runs a set of sub-agents repeatedly *until a specific condition is met or a maximum number of iterations is reached.* This creates a refinement cycle, allowing the agent system to improve its own work over and over.\n\n**Use Loop when:** Iterative improvement is needed, quality refinement matters, or you need repeated cycles.\n\nTo learn more, check out the documentation related to [loop agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/loop-agents/).\n\n**Architecture: Story Writing & Critique Loop**\n\n<!--\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[\"Initial Prompt\"] -- > B[\"Writer Agent\"]\n    B -- >|story| C[\"Critic Agent\"]\n    C -- >|critique| D{\"Iteration < Max<br>AND<br>Not Approved?\"}\n    D -- >|Yes| B\n    D -- >|No| E[\"Final Story\"]\n\n    style B fill:#ccffcc\n    style C fill:#ffcccc\n    style D fill:#ffffcc\n```\n-->","metadata":{"id":"fP4I3mvtBtHF"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img width=\"250\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/kaggle-5days-ai/day1/loop-agent.png\" alt=\"Loop Agent\" />","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 5.1 Example: Iterative Story Refinement\n\nLet's build a system with two agents:\n\n1. **Writer Agent** - Writes a draft of a short story\n2. **Critic Agent** - Reviews and critiques the short story to suggest improvements","metadata":{"id":"fP4I3mvtBtHF"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This agent runs ONCE at the beginning to create the first draft.\ninitial_writer_agent = Agent(\n    name=\"InitialWriterAgent\",\n    model=Gemini(\n        model=\"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\",\n        retry_options=retry_config\n    ),\n    instruction=\"\"\"Based on the user's prompt, write the first draft of a short story (around 100-150 words).\n    Output only the story text, with no introduction or explanation.\"\"\",\n    output_key=\"current_story\",  # Stores the first draft in the state.\n)\n\nprint(\"✅ initial_writer_agent created.\")","metadata":{"id":"a2b8WlJoBtHF","outputId":"13ed1e15-dcf9-4e1d-ad1e-fb18ee793de5","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2026-01-23T07:59:54.296560Z","iopub.execute_input":"2026-01-23T07:59:54.296962Z","iopub.status.idle":"2026-01-23T07:59:54.303318Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2026-01-23T07:59:54.296932Z","shell.execute_reply":"2026-01-23T07:59:54.302292Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"✅ initial_writer_agent created.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":31},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This agent's only job is to provide feedback or the approval signal.

His life was a predictable rhythm of lamp checks and foghorn blasts. One blustery Tuesday, while clearing out the dusty attic, his hand brushed against a loose floorboard. Beneath it lay a brittle, rolled-up parchment. Unfurling it carefully, Elias gasped. It wasn't paper, but some strange, shimmering material that pulsed with a soft, internal light. Intricate lines, like constellations, traced a path across its surface, leading to no land he recognized. As he held it, the map's glow intensified, projecting faint, shifting images onto the salt-crusted windowpane – islands of impossible design, currents that defied nature, and a single, radiant star. A chill, not entirely of the sea, traced its way down his spine.\nCriticAgent > The story has a strong opening that effectively establishes Elias's routine and the isolated setting of the lighthouse. The discovery of the map is intriguing, and the description of its material and projected images is vivid. However, the plot feels a little thin as it currently stands.\n\nHere are 2-3 specific, actionable suggestions for improvement:\n\n1.  **Flesh out Elias's reaction and motivation:** While Elias gasps and feels a chill, his internal reaction could be explored further. Is he fearful, curious, or perhaps a mix? What does this discovery *mean* to him after thirty years of predictability? Does it awaken a dormant desire for adventure, or does it represent a threat to his quiet life? Showing more of his internal thoughts and feelings will make him a more compelling character.\n2.  **Hint at the map's potential purpose or origin:** The map shows \"islands of impossible design\" and \"currents that defied nature.\" This is evocative, but a slight hint at *why* this map exists or what it might lead to would deepen the mystery. For example, could the \"radiant star\" be a destination, a power source, or a warning? Even a subtle suggestion would add another layer to the narrative hook.\n3.  **Consider a more immediate consequence or action:** The story ends with Elias's chill. While this is a good hook, a slight extension could show a more immediate, albeit small, consequence or action taken by Elias. Perhaps he tries to decipher a symbol, or the map’s glow reveals something else in the attic, or he feels compelled to look out at the sea in a new way. This would give the reader a stronger sense of forward momentum, even if it’s just a tiny step.\nRefinerAgent > Elias had tended the Blackrock Lighthouse for thirty years. His life was a predictable rhythm of lamp checks and foghorn blasts, a solitary existence that had long ago smoothed out any rough edges of his soul. One blustery Tuesday, however, that placid surface was shattered. While clearing out the dusty attic, a space as forgotten as his own youthful dreams, his hand brushed against a loose floorboard. Beneath it lay a brittle, rolled-up parchment.\n\nUnfurling it carefully, Elias gasped. It wasn't paper, but some strange, shimmering material that pulsed with a soft, internal light, cool and alive beneath his calloused fingertips. Intricate lines, like constellations spun from moonlight, traced a path across its surface, leading to no land he recognized. As he held it, the map's glow intensified, projecting faint, shifting images onto the salt-crusted windowpane – islands of impossible design that seemed to float in the air, currents that defied nature, swirling with phosphorescent energy, and at their heart, a single, radiant star.\n\nA chill, not entirely of the sea, traced its way down his spine. Thirty years. Thirty years of the same horizon, the same gulls, the same predictable cycle of storms and calm. And now this. It wasn't just a map; it felt like a key, a silent invitation. Curiosity warred with a primal fear of the unknown. What was this place? Who made this map, and why was it hidden here, in *his* lighthouse? The radiant star at its center pulsed, and Elias felt an inexplicable pull, a yearning for something beyond the foghorn's mournful cry. He traced a symbol near the star – a spiral within a circle. As his finger moved, the projected image of the star flared, and for a fleeting moment, Elias thought he saw a shape coalesce in the light on the windowpane – a ship, unlike any he'd ever seen, with sails like wings. The attic air suddenly felt charged, and Elias, the man of routine, felt a dangerous stirring of adventure in his chest. He gripped the map tighter, his gaze fixed on the impossibly distant, radiant star.\nCriticAgent > APPROVED\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stderr","text":"WARNING:google_genai.types:Warning: there are non-text parts in the response: ['function_call'], returning concatenated text result from text parts.
