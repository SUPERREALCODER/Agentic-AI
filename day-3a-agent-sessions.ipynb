These are just some of the highlights, and new breakthroughs are happening constantly.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Are there any new developments in drug discovery?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  Yes, there are continuous and exciting new developments in AI-driven drug discovery. Here are some of the key areas where AI is making a significant impact:\n\n**1. Accelerating Target Identification:**\n\n*   **Genomic and Proteomic Analysis:** AI algorithms are getting much better at sifting through massive datasets of genomic, proteomic, and transcriptomic data to identify novel biological targets (genes, proteins) that are implicated in diseases. This moves beyond known targets to discover entirely new avenues for therapeutic intervention.\n*   **Literature Mining and Knowledge Graphs:** AI can rapidly analyze scientific literature, patents, and clinical trial data to identify connections between genes, proteins, diseases, and potential drug targets that humans might miss. Knowledge graphs help visualize these complex relationships.\n*   **Predicting Disease Mechanisms:** AI models can help researchers understand the complex biological pathways and mechanisms underlying diseases, leading to the identification of more precise and effective targets.\n\n**2. Revolutionizing Molecule Design and Optimization:**\n\n*   **Generative Models for Novel Molecules:** This is a huge area of advancement. AI models (like Generative Adversarial Networks - GANs, and Variational Autoencoders - VAEs, and more recently, transformer-based models) can *generate* entirely new molecular structures with desired properties, rather than just screening existing ones. This allows for the creation of molecules optimized for binding to a specific target, with desired ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, Toxicity) properties.\n*   **De Novo Drug Design:** AI is enabling \"de novo\" drug design, meaning creating molecules from scratch, specifically tailored to a target, rather than modifying existing drugs.\n*   **Predicting Molecular Properties:** AI can accurately predict a wide range of properties for a potential drug candidate, including:\n    *   **Binding affinity:** How well a molecule will bind to its target.\n    *   **Solubility and permeability:** How well it can be absorbed and distributed in the body.\n    *   **Toxicity:** Potential harmful side effects.\n    *   **Metabolic stability:** How long it will remain active in the body.\n*   **Optimizing Lead Compounds:** Once a promising \"lead\" compound is identified, AI can suggest modifications to improve its efficacy, reduce toxicity, and enhance pharmacokinetic properties, speeding up the optimization process.\n\n**3. Enhancing Pre-clinical and Clinical Trials:**\n\n*   **Predicting Drug Efficacy and Toxicity:** AI can analyze pre-clinical data (cell-based assays, animal studies) to better predict how a drug will perform in humans, potentially reducing the failure rate in later stages.\n*   **Biomarker Discovery:** AI can identify biomarkers that predict patient response to a drug, enabling more targeted clinical trials and personalized medicine approaches.\n*   **Clinical Trial Design Optimization:** AI can help design more efficient clinical trials by identifying ideal patient populations, predicting enrollment rates, and even optimizing dosing regimens.\n*   **Analyzing Real-World Evidence:** AI can process vast amounts of real-world data (electronic health records, insurance claims) to understand how drugs perform in diverse patient populations outside of controlled clinical trial settings.\n\n**4. Advancements in Specific Disease Areas:**\n\n*   **Cancer Therapies:** AI is instrumental in developing personalized cancer vaccines, identifying new targets for immunotherapy, and predicting response to various cancer treatments.\n*   **Neurological Disorders:** AI is being used to discover drugs for Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and other neurodegenerative diseases by understanding complex protein folding and aggregation mechanisms.\n*   **Infectious Diseases:** AI is accelerating the discovery of new antibiotics and antivirals, a critical need in the face of rising antimicrobial resistance.\n\n**Examples of Companies and Initiatives:**\n\nMany biotech and pharmaceutical companies are heavily investing in AI for drug discovery, including:\n\n*   **Atomwise, Insilico Medicine, Recursion Pharmaceuticals, Exscientia:** These are just a few of the AI-native drug discovery companies that are making significant strides.\n*   **Major pharmaceutical companies (e.g., Pfizer, Novartis, Roche):** These giants are increasingly partnering with AI companies or building their own AI capabilities.\n\n**The Future Outlook:**\n\nThe trend is towards AI becoming an indispensable partner in the drug discovery process. We can expect to see:\n\n*   **Faster time to market for new drugs.**\n*   **More effective and personalized medicines.**\n*   **Discovery of treatments for previously untreatable diseases.**\n*   **A shift from \"trial and error\" to more predictive and rational drug design.**\n\nIt's a very active and rapidly evolving area, with new research and discoveries being published frequently.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the second development I mentioned in my previous response regarding AI in drug discovery: **Revolutionizing Molecule Design and Optimization.**\n\nThis is arguably one of the most groundbreaking applications of AI in this field. Here's a deeper dive into what it entails:\n\n**The Traditional Challenge of Molecule Design:**\n\nHistorically, drug discovery involved a lot of serendipity and brute-force screening. Scientists would:\n\n1.  **Identify a biological target:** A protein or pathway involved in a disease.\n2.  **Screen vast libraries of existing chemical compounds:** To find a few that might interact with the target.\n3.  **Modify promising \"lead\" compounds:** Through iterative chemical synthesis and testing to improve their effectiveness, reduce side effects, and make them suitable for the body.\n\nThis process was extremely time-consuming, expensive, and had a high failure rate because the chemical space (the universe of all possible molecules) is astronomically large. It's impossible to synthesize and test even a tiny fraction of all potential drug-like molecules.\n\n**How AI is Revolutionizing This:**\n\nAI, particularly **generative AI models**, is changing this paradigm by enabling *in silico* (computer-based) creation of novel molecules with desired properties. Here's how:\n\n**1. Generative Models for Novel Molecules:**\n\n*   **What they are:** These are sophisticated machine learning algorithms designed to learn the underlying patterns and rules of chemical structures and then generate new, plausible molecules based on that learned knowledge. Think of it like an artist learning the style of a master painter and then creating new works in that style.\n*   **Types of Models:**\n    *   **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** Consist of two neural networks – a generator (that creates molecules) and a discriminator (that tries to distinguish real molecules from generated ones). They compete, pushing the generator to create increasingly realistic and novel molecules.\n    *   **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):** Learn a compressed representation (a \"latent space\") of molecules and can then sample from this space to generate new ones.\n    *   **Transformer-based models (similar to those used in language processing):** Can learn the \"grammar\" of chemical structures and generate sequences of atoms and bonds that form valid molecules.\n*   **Key Capability:** The ability to move beyond simply *screening* existing molecules to actively *designing* new ones that have never been synthesized before.\n\n**2. De Novo Drug Design:**\n\n*   **Meaning:** \"De novo\" means \"from the beginning.\" AI is enabling \"de novo\" drug design, where the AI system starts with nothing but the desired target and a set of desired properties and then generates a completely novel molecular structure that fits those requirements.\n*   **Process:** A researcher defines the target (e.g., a specific protein that needs to be inhibited or activated) and specifies desired characteristics for the molecule (e.g., high binding affinity, good solubility, low toxicity, ability to cross the blood-brain barrier). The AI model then goes to work, exploring the vast chemical space to propose candidate molecules.\n\n**3. Predicting Molecular Properties with High Accuracy:**\n\n*   **Beyond Structure:** AI doesn't just generate structures; it also predicts their behavior. This includes:\n    *   **Binding Affinity:** How strongly a molecule will bind to its intended biological target. This is crucial for efficacy.\n    *   **ADMET Properties:**\n        *   **Absorption:** How well it gets into the body.\n        *   **Distribution:** Where it goes in the body.\n        *   **Metabolism:** How it's broken down by the body.\n        *   **Excretion:** How it's removed from the body.\n        *   **Toxicity:** Potential harmful effects.\n    *   **Physicochemical Properties:** Like solubility, stability, and reactivity.\n*   **In Silico Screening:** By accurately predicting these properties, AI can \"virtually screen\" millions of generated or existing molecules much faster and cheaper than physical lab testing. This helps researchers prioritize the most promising candidates for synthesis and experimental validation.\n\n**4. Optimizing Lead Compounds:**\n\n*   **Iterative Improvement:** Even when an initial promising molecule is found, AI can help optimize it. By understanding structure-activity relationships (how changes in the molecule's structure affect its activity), AI can suggest specific modifications to improve potency, reduce off-target effects, or enhance pharmacokinetic profiles.\n*   **Navigating the \"Optimization Landscape\":** The process of tweaking a lead compound can be complex. AI can intelligently guide this exploration, finding optimal combinations of chemical modifications more efficiently.\n\n**Impact and Benefits:**\n\n*   **Speed:** Significantly reduces the time it takes to go from identifying a target to having viable drug candidates.\n*   **Cost Reduction:** By performing much of the screening and initial optimization computationally, AI lowers the cost of early-stage drug discovery.\n*   **Novelty:** AI can explore chemical space in ways that humans might not conceive, leading to entirely new classes of drugs and potentially treating diseases that are currently difficult to address.\n*   **Higher Success Rates:** By identifying more promising candidates earlier and predicting potential issues like toxicity, AI aims to improve the success rate of drugs progressing through the development pipeline.\n\nIn essence, AI is transforming drug discovery from a process of extensive searching to one of intelligent design and predictive validation. It's a powerful tool that is accelerating the development of new medicines for a wide range of diseases.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  There are many companies involved in leveraging AI for drug discovery, ranging from AI-native startups to large pharmaceutical giants.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer.

This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
